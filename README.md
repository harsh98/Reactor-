# Reactor

"You are to design, implement, and test a program to simulate and control a very simplified nuclear reactor. (You may pretend it belongs to either Ontario Hydro or the Soviet government.) If not kept under control, the reactor will melt down, killing hundreds of thousands of people. If kept on too tight a leash, the reactor will not produce enough power, and you will be fired. Tough decision."
